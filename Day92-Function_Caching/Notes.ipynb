    "## Function Caching in Python\n",
    "Function caching is a technique for improving the performance of a program by storing the results of a function call so that you can reuse the results instead of recomputing them every time the function is called. This can be particularly useful when a function is computationally expensive, or when the inputs to the function are unlikely to change frequently.\n",

    "## Benefits of Function Caching\n",
    "Function caching can have a significant impact on the performance of a program, particularly for computationally expensive functions. By caching the results of a function, you can avoid having to recompute the results every time the function is called, which can save a significant amount of time and computational resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another benefit of function caching is that it can simplify the code of a program by removing the need to manually cache the results of a function. With the `functools.lru_cache` decorator, the caching is handled automatically, so you can focus on writing the core logic of your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "It works using the concept of memoization, which is a computer programming optimization technique that speeds up programs by storing the results of expensive function calls and reusing them when the same inputs occur again. It works by using a cache, such as a hash map, to store the outputs for specific inputs, which allows the function to avoid re-computing the result and instead return the stored value from the cache. This is particularly effective for recursive algorithms that might re-calculate the same values multiple times. "

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Function caching is a technique for improving the performance of a program by storing the results of a function so that you can reuse the results instead of recomputing them every time the function is called. In Python 3, function caching can be achieved using the `functools.lru_cache` decorator, which provides an easy and efficient way to cache the results of a function. Whether you're writing a computationally expensive program, or just want to simplify your code, function caching is a great technique to have in your toolbox."
