    "## Hybrid Inheritance in Python\n",
    "Hybrid inheritance is a combination of multiple inheritance and single inheritance in object-oriented programming. It is a type of inheritance in which multiple inheritance is used to inherit the properties of multiple base classes into a single derived class, and single inheritance is used to inherit the properties of the derived class into a sub-derived class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, hybrid inheritance can be implemented by creating a class hierarchy, in which a base class is inherited by multiple derived classes, and one of the derived classes is further inherited by a sub-derived class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax for implementing Hybrid Inheritance in Python is the same as for implementing Single Inheritance, Multiple Inheritance, or Hierarchical Inheritance.\n",
