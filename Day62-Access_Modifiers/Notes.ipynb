    "In Python, there is no strict concept of \"private\" access modifiers like in some other programming languages. However, a convention has been established to indicate that a variable or method should be considered private by prefixing its name with a double underscore (__). This is known as a \"weak internal use indicator\" and it is a convention only, not a strict rule. Code outside the class can still access these \"private\" variables and methods, but it is generally understood that they should not be accessed or modified."

For example, if a class has a method called _my_method, it is indicating that the method should only be accessed by the class itself and its subclasses.\n",
