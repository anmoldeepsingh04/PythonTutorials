    "## The time Module\n",
    "The `time` module in Python provides a set of functions to work with time-related operations, such as timekeeping, formatting, and time conversions. This module is part of the Python Standard Library and is available in all Python installations, making it a convenient and essential tool for a wide range of applications."

The returned value is based on the computer's system clock and is affected by time adjustments made by the operating system, such as daylight saving time. Here's an example:"
