    "## Multilevel Inheritance in Python\n",
    "Multilevel inheritance is a type of inheritance in object-oriented programming where a derived class inherits from another derived class. This type of inheritance allows you to build a hierarchy of classes where one class builds upon another, leading to a more specialized class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, multilevel inheritance is achieved by using the class hierarchy. The syntax for multilevel inheritance is quite simple and follows the same syntax as single inheritance."
